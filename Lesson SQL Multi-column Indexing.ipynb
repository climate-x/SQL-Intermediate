    "\n",
    "`SQLite` returns only a high-level query plan when we use the `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` statement in front of a query. This means that we'll often have to augment the returned query plan with your own understanding of the available indexes. In this case, the facts table has 2 indexes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- one ordered by `population` called `pop_idx`,\n",
    "- one ordered by `population_growth`, called `pop_growth_idx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite struggles to take advantage of both indexes since each index is optimized for lookups on just that column. SQLite can use the indexes to quickly find the row `id` values where **either** population is greater than 1000000 or where population_growth is less than 0.05. If SQLite uses the index of population values to return all of the row `id` values where population is less than 1000000, it can't use those id values to search the `pop_growth_idx` index quickly to find the rows where `population_growth` is less than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the query plan, we can infer that `SQLite` first decided to use the `pop_growth_idx` index to return the `id` values for the rows where population_growth was less than 0.05. Then, SQLite used a `binary search` on the `facts` table to access the row at each `id` value, add that row to a temporary collection if the value for population was greater than 1000000, and return the collection of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why `SQLite` chose the `pop_growth_idx` instead of the `pop_idx`is, because when there are 2 possible indexes available, `SQLite` tries to estimate which index will result in better performance. To keep SQLite lightweight, limited ability was added to estimate and plan accurately and `SQLite` often ends up picking an index at random."

    "### Multi-column Index\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like above, we need to create a multi-column index that contains values from both of the columns we're filtering on. This way, both criteria in the `WHERE` statement can be evaluted in the index itself and the `facts` table will only be queried at the end when we have the specific row `id` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the single column indexes contain just the primary key column (`population`) and the row `id` (id) columns, the multi-column index contains the `population_growth` column as well. SQLite can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use binary search to find the first row in this index where population is greater than 1000000,\n",
    "- add the row to a `temporary collection` if `population_growth` is less than 0.05,\n",
    "- advance to the next row (the index is ordered by population),\n",
    "- add the row to a temporary collection if population_growth is less than 0.05,\n",
    "- when the end of the index is reached, look up each row in `facts` using the `id` values from the `temporary collection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the `facts` table is only accessed at the end and the index is used to process the `WHERE` criteria.\n",
    "When creating a multi-column index, we need to specify which of the columns we want as the `primary key`. In the example above, this means that `SQLit`e can use `binary search` to quickly jump to the first row that matches a specific population value but not before identifyingg it with the first row that matches a specific population_growth value."
